Create a personal portfolio website with a nostalgic early 2000s web design aesthetic inspired by Alibaba.com circa 2000, but enhanced with modern skeuomorphic and neomorphic elements. The design should include:

1. Layout Structure:
   - Classic table-based layout with clearly defined sections
   - Header with navigation bar using colored button-like tabs
   - Sidebar with personal stats/information
   - Main content area with project showcases
   - Footer with links and copyright information

2. Color Scheme:
   - Primary colors: Orange (#FF7700) headers and accents
   - Secondary colors: Blue (#003366) for navigation elements
   - Light yellow (#FFFDE8) for information boxes
   - White backgrounds with light gray borders

3. Skeuomorphic Elements:
   - 3D button effects with beveled edges and subtle drop shadows
   - Paper/document-like textures for content areas
   - Folder tab navigation elements
   - "Embossed" headings with subtle highlights and shadows

4. Neomorphic Elements:
   - Soft UI components for feature cards
   - Light source consistent from top-left
   - Subtle extrusion effects on information boxes
   - Gentle curves and rounded corners on modern elements

5. Typography:
   - Main headings: Arial or Verdana, bold
   - Body text: Simple sans-serif fonts
   - Use table cells for text alignment
   - Maintain the classic "Tidings" or "News" section with dates

6. Navigation:
   - Top horizontal navigation bar with colored tabs
   - Side menu with categorized links
   - "Home" button clearly visible

7. Content Sections:
   - "About Me" section (similar to "About Alibaba")
   - "Projects" section with categorized listings and numbers in parentheses
   - "Latest News" section with dates
   - "Contact Information" in sidebar

8. Interactive Elements:
   - Search box with dropdown selection
   - Simple form inputs with neomorphic styling
   - "Sign In" area
   - Featured project showcase

9. Decorative Elements:
   - Simple icons for categories
   - Horizontal dividers between sections
   - Small "NEW" markers for recent additions
   - Statistics counter for site visits or projects

10. Responsive Considerations:
    - While maintaining the retro aesthetic, ensure the design can adapt to modern devices
    - Create breakpoints that preserve the table-like structure on smaller screens
